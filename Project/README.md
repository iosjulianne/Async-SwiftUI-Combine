# Project 

Convert this weather app to Combine:
https://github.com/kroshkaEvan/Weather


##  Quick Overview

### Praise:

- Beautiful, aesthetically pleasing app
	- cute font, text, colors
	- nice scrollability and layout
- Code is organized well
- Used generics for Network Manager

### Critiques:

- Search bar
	- There's no error or feedback for the search function (e.g. "This place does not exist", "weather updated for new input")
	- Not intuitive - You have to erase the name, then press the magnifying glass to search and update. I initially thought you press the search button and a prompt would pop up to input a new location

### Places to add Combine:

- fetchWeather in Network Manager still using URLSession dataTask
- getLocation

## Notes:

### Praise:

- Beautiful, aestethically pleasing app
	- cute font, text, colors
	- nice scrollability and layout

### Critiques:

- Search bar
	- There's no error or feedback for the search function (e.g. "This place does not exist", "weather updated for new input")
	- Not intuitive - You have to erase the name, then press the magnifying glass to search and update. I initially thought you press the search button and a prompt would pop up to input a new location

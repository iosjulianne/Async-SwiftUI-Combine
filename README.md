<!-- GENERAL NOTES -->
### ðŸ“š Vocabulary
**DSL** - Domain Specific Language<br>
**Opaque type** - "some" keyword turns type into opaque type. This means that the compiler still has access to the underlying concrete type, but clients of the module donâ€™t â€” they just see the protocol of the return value<br>
**pyramid of doom** - deeply nested code thatâ€™s difficult to navigate<br>
**source of truth** - the data that determines the state of the UI. There can only be one source of truth for each UI element.


### ðŸ”¥ Hot Keys
* Run *(CMD + R)*
* Debug Console *(CMD + Shift + C)*
* Resume Preview *(CMD + Option + P)*
* Preview Canvas *(CMD + Option + Enter)*

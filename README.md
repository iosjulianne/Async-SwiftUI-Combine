<!-- GENERAL NOTES -->
### üìö Vocabulary
**DSL** - Domain Specific Language<br>
**Opaque type** - "some" keyword turns type into opaque type. This means that the compiler still has access to the underlying concrete type, but clients of the module don‚Äôt ‚Äî they just see the protocol of the return value<br>
**pyramid of doom** - deeply nested code that‚Äôs difficult to navigate<br>
**source of truth** - the data that determines the state of the UI. There can only be one source of truth for each UI element.

<!-- GENERAL NOTES -->
### üìö Vocabulary
**DSL** - Domain Specific Language<br>
**Opaque type** - "some" keyword turns type into opaque type. This means that the compiler still has access to the underlying concrete type, but clients of the module don‚Äôt ‚Äî they just see the protocol of the return value<br>
**pyramid of doom** - deeply nested code that‚Äôs difficult to navigate<br>
**source of truth** - the data that determines the state of the UI. There can only be one source of truth for each UI element.<br>
**callback** - a function that is passed as an argument and executes when a specific condition or event occurs<br>
**idempotent** - if you perform the operation or function once or multiple times, the outcome remains the same<br>
**toast** - an overlay that shows for a brief moment and then disappears<br>
**payload** - the data sent from a server in response to a network request<br>
**exponential backoff** - a strategy used in networking and communication protocols to handle retries and manage network congestion; progressively increase the delay between retry attempts when a network request fails<br>
**projected value** - a combine term that refers to a property or value that is projected from a publisher or operator. It allows you to access additional information or perform further operations on the publisher or operator<br>
**synchronously** - tasks performed one after another<br>
**asynchronously** - not happening or done at the same time or speed <br>‚Ä®**thread explosion** - a situation where a program or system creates an excessive number of threads, causing resource exhaustion and degradation in performance<br>
**closures** - self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code<br> 
**suspension points** ‚Äì the places where a function can be suspended
